# mascot.ai

> [!IMPORTANT]
Right now, just and only run `tts_engine.py`. Even though we are importing all other files into `mascot.ai.py` (main file or entry point), the idea isn't clear and without running **VTubeStudio** first, `mascot.ai.py` will not run as we might expect. There is nothing I can do as I can't even run **VTubeStudio** and my IDE at the same time.

- Right now it requires additional software like **Voicemeeter** to make, for example the terminal this program ran from, act as the microphone source for the **VTubeStudio**.

- There is no real interaction or anything useful going on with this and **VTubeStudio** at the moment.

    - But for this, I'll need additional information, like what is the end goal of this script/program?

    - Depending on that, either we can keep going with **Voicemeeter** setup and let this script only handle two parts: Getting the YouTube Live chat messages and Reading them alound (TTS).

    - OR, implement something like, this programms own audio driver that can on it's own can act as the microphone.

    - We certainly don't need or care about it's interaction with **VTubeStudio** (if all the above cases satisfy).

- Also then, what do we want this program to achieve in interaction with **VTubeStudio**?

    - ?
